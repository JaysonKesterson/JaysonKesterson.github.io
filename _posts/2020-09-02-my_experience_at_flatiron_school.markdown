Approximately ten months ago, my journey as a programmer began when I made the decision to apply to Flatiron School. At the time I didn't really know exactly what I was getting into, having very limited programming knowledge at the start, but a lot can change in ten months. I never realized just how much I could learn in such a perceived short amount of time. Ruby, Rails, Javascript, React, Redux are some of the languages and frameworks we really took a deep dive into and I feel I have a strong understanding of each of them. I feel Flatiron prepared me to build my portfolio with projects, handle the stress of live assessments and evaluations and to truly pursue knowledge. 

## Weekly Labs and Assignments

The weekly grind of completing an assortment of labs throughout my time at Flatiron was the first thing to get used to. Starting with a bunch of failing tests and having to use test-driven development was new to me, but I learned that nothing is more satisfying than taking on the challenge of passing a test and finally figuring out how to solve the error. Being in the part-time pacing Software Engineering cohort I definitely was able to handle balancing my normal life with the weekly assignments that I was responsible for completing. The pacing in learning was also pretty balanced, I felt as though by the time a new week's work was assigned I had a strong grasp on the concepts from the previous week.

## Project Mode

Other than weekly assignments, the five projects were spaced out well and the two week intervals for spending time solely on projects was definitely fair. Projects could be difficult depending on the topics you are trying to achieve, but I can honestly say the times of confusion and trial and error lead to the most true learning in this experience. Building each project from the ground up allowed for the true test of my knowledge on the subject at hand and really encourage the preservation of concepts because they are being used in a more realistic scenario than the labs are. The assessments of these projects were challenging but essential to ensuring that I have a true understanding of my code and how to best utilize it. The main thing I will remember from Flatiron projects is how rewarding it can be to start with a hypothetical final product in your mind and eventually bring that abstract thought to reality in my code.

## My Takeaways

The main thing that I want to take from this experience is to not let my pursuit of learning stop here. There are so many languages and frameworks to learn, and now I have confidence that I am capable of learning any language that I strive for. Flatirons pacing and learning path helped me in learning a lot of important coding concepts and create cool projects I never would have thought I would have been able to create beforehand. I am excited to see where the rest of my programming journey takes me, and can thank Flatiron for paving the path for me.
