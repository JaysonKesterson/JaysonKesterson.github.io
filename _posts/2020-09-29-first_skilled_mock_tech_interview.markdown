After completing and graduating from Flatiron School's curriculum the next step has been creating a personal brand and networking skills that can help me land a job in the tech industry. With assistance from my career coach I have created an updated resume, Linkedin profile and practiced cultural interviews and building my network. The final step before actually declaring my job search start date was to head over to the Skilled website and tackle a Mock Technical Interview with a Senior Level Develper and get their feedback. 

## Preparation for the Interview

When signing up for the interview I decided to have it be based around Javascript, one of the main languages we learned in Flatiron's curriculum. Before the mock interview I brushed up on a lot of Javascript concepts and reviewed data structures which weren't covered extensively in Flatiron's curriculum. I learned about Stacks, Queues, Heaps and Trees and funny enough when the interview came around the studying paid off because the interviewer asked me questions specifically about these data structures. I also reviewed a lot about advice on how to handle interviewer questions and the structure of technical interviews to better prepare myself.

## The Interview

When I joined the interview I immediately went from being nervous to feeling at ease because my interviewer was very approachable and easy to talk to. We introduced ourselves and then she proceeded to ask me conceptual questions about Javascript, which included questions about data structures, data types and Javascript as a language. I knew the answers to the concept questions so the beginning of the interview went very smoothly, and my confidence was building. The next step was a coding challenge in Javascript, I ended up correctly solving the problem but it definitely took me some time, problem solving and the help of a few google searches to remember some syntax. I definitely need to also work on my ability to vocalize my thought process while being watched programming so I can make it clear what is going through my mind. All in all I got a 4/5 on the mock interview, and the interviewer left me some helpful feedback.

## Feedback and Takeaways

My main takeaways from this experience are what I learned about how to approach the interview and what to expect for the real technical interviews I may land going forward. I feel a lot more comfortable and confident about how to prepare for interviews like this, with research and practicing concepts and challenges I may expert to arise in the coding exercise. I still have a lot of work to do, maintaining a weekly coding schedule to stay fresh and up to date in tech and continue to pursue as much knowledge as I can. My interviewer provided me with a lot of feedback and articles to research to sharpen my coding skills, and with those and just maintaining a weekly coding routine I am confident that when a real technical interview comes around I will be able to do a great job and impress the interviewer.
